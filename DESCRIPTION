Title: Finds "Local Subnetworks" Within an Interaction Network which Show Enrichment for Differentially Expressed Genes

Description: Implements the method described in "Network-based analysis of omics data: The LEAN method".
 Given a protein interaction network and a list of p-values describing a measure of interest (as e.g. differential gene expression) this method
 computes an enrichment p-value for the protein neighborhood of each gene and compares it to a background distribution of randomly drawn p-values.
 The resulting scores are corrected for multiple testing and significant hits are returned in tabular format.
